# Workshop: Creating Cloud Native Applications with Cloud Pak for Applications on OpenShift

## Agenda

We'll be using the Cloud Pak for Applications platform to perform the following tasks:

### Day 1: Kabanero and Appsody for Developers and Operators

In this frist day we'll learn how to use Appsody to run the *inner loop* of the development and test cycle for a developer, and how these tools can be integrated into your favorite IDE. We'll also explore how to deploy an application to OpenShift first manually with Appsody and then using the standard Kabanero Tekton piplines with GitOps.

| [Exercise 4: Use Tekton and Kabanero Pipelines to continuously deploy](exercise-4/README.md) | Deploy the built applications to IBM Managed OpenShift using GitOps to trigger a Tekton pipeline |


### Day 2: Customizing Stacks, Pipelines in Kabanero Collections

* **Building a custom Kabanero Collection**
  * Create a collection that will contain custom appsody stacks and pipelines

#### Customizing Stacks for Solution Architects (Track 1)

* **Customizing an existing Appsody Stack**
  * Create a custom stack, to be hosted in our custom repository
* **Managing custom stacks in a custom Kabanero Collection**
  * Learn how to manage these custom stacks and how to make them available to developers.

#### Customizing Kabanero Collections for Operators (Track 2)

* **Create a custom Tekton pipleline for a custom Collection**
  * Build a pipeline that will fit into a custom Kabanero collection

#### Using your custom collections in Kabanero (Final Common Track)

* **Deploy Application with Custom Stack & Pipeline**
  * Build and deploy an application using the custom stack, collection and pipelines built by the Architects' and Operators' tracks
